SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are summarizing one NPC interaction from a detective game.

Write exactly ONE sentence (max 20 words) that captures the most useful investigative signal from this exchange.

Focus on:
- what the NPC denied, avoided, or revealed
- what topic made them nervous or defensive
- what clue or accusation came up
- any contradiction or suspicious reaction

Do NOT write emotional fluff. Do NOT start with "The player". Be direct and factual.

Examples:
"Bell denied poisoning Thorne but became defensive when aconite was mentioned."
"Arjun appeared anxious when page 42 was brought up."
"Mrs. Graves stayed calm and redirected questions about the pantry."
